will put the code here soon :)

If you have any questions just DM Spooky on discord: `Spooky#0683` | [Website](https://itsspooky.netlify.app/ "Spooky's Website")

Prefix is `/` | To change prefix `/changeprefix <prefix>`
 
Note: Bot is still in development, if you want to suggest anythingy do `/suggest <suggestion>`. I am currently hosting the bot in Repl.it, so I'm sorry if the bot just suddenly becomes offline, you can DM the owner on discord: `Spooky#0683` to turn it on again ðŸ˜…

Note: Don't include the `< >` and if the title or description is longer than a word put `" "`

Have Fun! :D
