  - My motivation for completing this project has depleted. The library I used to develop this bot, Discord.py, has been discontinued. As a result, I'm also discontinuing this project. It will remain online, but it will no longer get updates. Due to the discontinuation of the project, I will be removing the Invite Link, so don't kick the bot because you can't invite the bot back. I hope you understand.

## Pack - Man
  Hello, I'm Pack-Man, a bot designed for quality-of-life commands for Minecraft Pack Making :)

Prefix is `pm/` | To change prefix `pm/changeprefix <prefix>`
 
Note: The bot is still in development, if you want to suggest anything do `pm/suggest <suggestion>`.


Have Fun! :D
