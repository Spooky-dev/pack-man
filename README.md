# pack-man
  A simple bot that generates a `manifest.json` for Minecraft Bedrock Resource and Behavior Packs
  
will put the code here soon :)

invite link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=842730997275557898&permissions=2617769041&scope=bot

prefix is "/"

Note: Bot is still in development, if you want to suggest anythingy do `/suggest <suggestion>`. I am currently hosting the bot in Repl.it, so I'm sorry if the bot just suddenly becomes offline, you can DM the owner on discord: `Spooky#0683` to turn it on again ðŸ˜… 
  
  
 
Features as of now:

- Generate a Resource and Behavior Pack Manifest.json `/manifest <resource/behavior> <title> <description>`
- Generate a version 4 UUID `/uuid`

Note: Don't include the `< >` and if the title or description is longer than a word put `" "`

Have Fun! :D
